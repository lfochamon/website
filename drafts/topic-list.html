<li>
<p>Things that can crush your soul as a scientist/PhD</p>
<ul>
<li>Feel like there's no momentum, no sense of growth</li>
<li>People are not reading your papers</li>
<li>People are not citing your papers</li>
<li>You just gave a conference talk to 2 people (one of which was the chair)</li>
<li>Happens every few years or so, there's some sort of cycles here too</li>
<li>Change approaches:<ul>
<li>stop with conferences, go to journal</li>
<li>give departmental talks, group meetings, reach out</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No success metrics</li>
<li>Low citations</li>
<li>Terrible google scholar</li>
<li>Lame numbers</li>
<li>You need to know what you're shooting for, but be careful with vanity metrics (numbers are not a measure of your worth)</li>
<li>Bad reviews, negative comments</li>
<li>You could have gotten 1000 papers, an award, that one bad review will ruining you</li>
<li>If this is happening consistently, maybe there's a self-assessment needed there :P</li>
<li>You have no new ideas</li>
<li>You have budget issues</li>
<li>Happens all the time in research and can make things move slowly</li>
<li>It can be really demotivating</li>
<li>Don't sit on your thumbs: go find an alternative project (simulation?)</li>
<li>You have no connections</li>
<li>Not hip and cool to know the right people</li>
<li>Shy and can't make connections</li>
<li>There's no one around you to meet (virtual conferences, outsider in a scientific community)</li>
<li>Science is a relationship business</li>
<li>Talk to other students: low stakes, not a lot to lose, and good way to practice connections</li>
<li>Also, students become professors or important people</li>
<li>Make genuine connections though, don't be a dick</li>
<li>We're all awkward but try not to be weird: social cues are cultural, but try to be on the safe side.
    But don't use that as an excuse to procrastinate!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set the agenda or it will be set for you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some unfortunate turn of events</p>
<ul>
<li>The benchmark mindset</li>

  and introducing basic academic reading and writing skills.<ul>
<li>Summer: first small research project</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Year 2: finish classes, gear up research (submit first conference paper), and
  start working on first journal<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Year 4: explore extensions of main project in another journal
  (student now pitches their own ideas)<ul>
<li>Summer: submit one journals and ML conference</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Year 5: continue publications, thesis writing, and job market preparation<ul>
<li>Summer: submit two journals and ML conference</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>

<li>
<p>Banned words/expressions</p>
<ul>
<li>Folklore: it is often used to express "commonly accepted belief" or "famous anecdote" rather than "traditional result." Only the latter is acceptable.</li>
<li>Anecdote: the collective of "anecdote" is not "data"</li>
<li>Hope: it either does or does not, there is no hoping. Worst offenders: "hope for robustness"; "in the hope that it will lead to better performance"</li>
<li>Believe: your beliefs are not relevant for science</li>
<li>Should: do or do not, there is no try (Yoda)</li>
<li>Prove/show/demonstrate (when referring to experiments): unless they are exhaustive (which is not the case), experiments (at best) suggest/indicate/illustrate</li>
<li>Flat minima: see folklore</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>25 things you're doing that are sabotaging your career</p>
<ul>
<li>Refuse to celebrate the success of others or the community</li>
<li>Unwilling to evolve: "it was better in the 60s"</li>
<li>Live presentation should be spontaneous</li>
<li>You think that because you're good, someone else should do the work</li>
<li>Marketing my music isn't cool</li>
<li>Someone else will have your best interest in mind</li>
<li>You're a dick</li>
<li>You're unreliable</li>
<li>Don't know how to build authentic relationships</li>
<li>You expect overnight success</li>
<li>Never asking for help</li>
<li>You have no direction or goals</li>
<li>Assuming everyone reads your specific journal (it's more scattered!)</li>
<li>Keep reworking old stuff</li>
<li>Not focusing on releasing papers</li>
<li>Can't take criticism</li>
<li>You don't admit that something is not working</li>
<li>Your stuff is so unique that it's indescribable, never done before, I don't need to cite all these people</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Antes de mais nada, eu levo revisoes a serio demais. Da pra fazer revisoes boas muito mais simples e menores do que as que eu escrevo. FYI.</p>
<p>De qualquer forma, a estrutura de uma revisão é sempre a mesma: 1 parágrafo que descreve o que o paper faz (tipo um abstract do abstract... eu tento reescrever com minhas palavras, mas resumir o abstract é o que muita gente faz); uma lista de issues; e uma decisao. Essas coisas de strengths e weakness, só escreve "See comments to authors". E escreve a revisão na última caixa.</p>
<p>O jeito mais fácil de revisar é ler o paper (de repente pode ir marcando umas coisas, se quiser) e decidir se vai aceitar ou rejeitar. Aí parte para a revisão. Congresso não tem segundo round de revisões, então minha política é: quando em dúvida, rejeita. O povo submete pro próximo congresso, se for o caso.</p>
<p>Se decidir aceitar, o parágrafo inicial tem que dar uma idéia de porque o paper é bom (tema novo? teoria sólida? resultado interessante?). Depois disso, você lista as coisas que teria que melhorar no paper (coisas que você acha que falta... não tem muita simulação, as provas são enroladas, o texto é complicado... se você não entendeu algo, é culpa do autor!). E fecha aceitando o paper.</p>
<p>Se decidir rejeitar, o parágrafo inicial vira simplesmente o resumo do resumo. Eu gosto também de dizer algo positivo (bem escrito, claro, sei lá). E depois disso você joga todos os motivos pelo qual o paper não está legal (sempre melhor tentar frasear do ponto de vista de "o paper não está pronto AINDA, mas se fizesse essas coisas talvez ficasse legal"... nem sempre é o caso, mas se possível... você vai ver que revisores podem ser bem agressivos e isso é ridículo).</p>
<p>Dependendo do dia ou da situação, eu uso dois formatos: (i) uma especie de texto mesmo (que nem as que estão em anexo); (ii) uma listagem de pontos (em geral com 3 itens: MAJOR ISSUES, as merdas grandes; MINOR ISSUES, coisas menores como typos ou unconventional notation; MISSING REFERENCES, se for o caso). Faço o que for mais fácil. Mesmo pra congresso, eu confiro bibliografia e demonstrações, mas isso quase ninguém faz (mesmo pra journal!). Não sinta que você precisa fazer ;)</p>

<li>The types of reviewers</li>
<li>The types of reviews: <a href="https://matt.might.net/articles/peer-fortress/">fortress</a>
  1. pointless: cite this...
  2. move the paper sideways: compare to this, more sims...
  3. improve the paper: clarifications, proof suggestions, some references...
  4. detrimental: muddy the waters, outside the scope, alternative problem formulation...</li>
<li>How to reply to reviewers?
  1. complain, but just do it
  2. just do it
  3. definitely do it!
  4. don't do it</li>
<li>The reply method</li>
<li>Copy the reviews</li>
<li>Breakdown into issues</li>
<li>Start every response with "The reviewer has a point"</li>
<li>Do's and Don't's</li>
<li>Do be cordial</li>
<li>Don't apologize</li>
<li>Do be topical: address the specific reviewer's point and not your own prejudice of what they might mean</li>
<li>Don't pander</li>
<li>Do be precise and specif</li>

<li>GRaVy: This stands for "Generalizations", "Refinements" and "Variations" and this one word
  represents the way that 80% of day-to-day mathematics (and mathematical science,
  including statistics and computer science) gets created. The paradigm needs no modification
  in mathematical statistics, and the story for applied statistics requires only small modification.</li>
<li>Start with something simple, then go "mine" for opportunities --Steele</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to get into a new field</p>
<ul>
<li>Go write a book on it</li>
<li>Goals</li>
<li>Goal 1: understand the underlying problem of the field</li>
<li>Goal 2: understand the approaches</li>
<li>Goal 3: determine the issues with the state of affairs</li>
<li>Goal 4: understand the solutions</li>
<li>Get 3 papers, read the intro and look at the references</li>
<li>Something keeps popping up: go read it (and look at the references)</li>
<li>Something is stated as fundamental: go read it (and look at the references)</li>
<li>Something looks familiar: formalize the parallel</li>
<li>A field is a problem, an approach, and many solutions</li>
<li>Good try: change each of these<ul>
<li>Problems: these are often hard to change. The field has accepted problems
  and often the problem defines the field. But sometimes certain small modifications
  make sense (different assumptions...). Be wary of making random modifications:
  if you don't know the field, you might just go turn the problem into one that makes no sense!</li>
<li>Approach: this is very nice. Fields are often stuck on specific approaches to solve problems.
  Different approaches have different advantages/disadvantages, so it's always good when walking
  into a new room to see if your typical pick-up lines would land. Might requiring tweaking the
  problem.</li>
<li>Solutions: sometimes (often) practical solutions are approximations of the actual ones. Sometimes
  these are great approximations, sometimes there's room for improvements. If you come from a
  "tool field," it's worth looking into whether your known solutions would fit here. That means
  mapping current problems to others or abstracting them. Again, this might require a change
  in problem and approach, but it's worth looking into. Be wary of just trying to use your
  hammer on a screw! This is an interesting thing to try, but requires some finesse...</li>

  in mathematical statistics, and the story for applied statistics requires only small modification.</li>
<li>Combining ideas: sometimes, Idea 1 in the field can be combined with Idea 2 in your field to get
  Idea 3 that isn't covered either of the original ones and is extremely interesting.</li>

<p>How to write math
  - Theorem, explanation, proof
  - Not a fan of the "informal statement": theorems are formal, explanations need not be (but still, stick to the facts!)
  - Always interpret and contextualize results
  - Explain what you're gonna do, do it, explain what you've done
  - NO LONG CHAINS OF EQUATIONS/INEQUALITIES: be verbose!
  - Try to avoid dealing with the arcane math terminology: just define things! (don't do like wiki)
  - Always be specific about what you're referencing (no "the previous equation," "the inequality above")

<p>Sloppy presentation is simply NOT ACCEPTABLE. If your presentation is not professionally executed,
    it is almost impossible to tell if your arguments are correct. Bizarrely enough, it's just like Mother said:
    "Neatness counts!" When the time comes to write real (publishable!) papers,
    you'll find huge benefits to knowing how to write your proofs clearly and honestly.</p>
<p>As I remind myself of what Rick has written, I note that he has a little tendency to prove a more general result and then collect simpler (more natural!) results as corollaries. For for example, he does the WLLN for triangular arrays before he does it for IID sequences.<br/>
I'd coach you to go the other way.<br/>
State the simplest version of the "theorem" that makes sense and prove that version first. Then look at your proof to see if you can extract from your proof: (1) a more general or (2) more precise version of your theorem.<br/>
I'd speculate that most "general theorems" are just simple theorems followed by some conscientious "proof mining". It's not a bold claim to assert that is the way that the world came to most of its collection of general results. Hilbert said that the path to mathematical discovery was through those examples that carry the germ of generality.<br/>
If you are interested in making your own contributions, I'd say that the "simple" to "general" path is the only way to go. The only caveat is that the words "simple" and "general" have many layers of interpretations. At this point --- why not take the simplest!<br/>
Look at the look at Tao's note on concentration. Tao's view of the Hoeffding inequalities was very instructive to me. I had Hoeffding in my head as a "convexity result" and I was honestly surprised to see that a useful version could be had by a crude Taylor series method. This is obvious once seen, but I never asked myself the question: "Can I just get by with an expansion?" By golly, the next time I see some convexity proof, I will ask myself that question.<br/>
The great benefit of a crude method is that it tends to be very robust. Tao's approach to Hoeffding makes inevitable the inequalities of Bennett and Bernstein (coming soon to a class room near you).<br/>
PS: There may not be any real ordering of ideas from complex to simple. It's certainly open to discussion whether a convexity argument is more fundamental than a Taylor series argument. Much of the time I'd side with convexity as being the simpler.As they say in the negotiations classes: "Why not both?" The two methods have robustness of differing kinds, so "proof mining" can lead from them in different directions.</p>
