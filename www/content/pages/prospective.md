## PhD student

{# I do not have PhD position calls open at the moment.
But feel free to [reach out](mailto&#58;{{SITEEMAIL}}?subject=[App PhD]) to discuss potential opportunities
if you are interested in working with me. I am always willing to consider outstanding students to join my group. #}


<div class='highlight' markdown=1>
I am currently looking for people interested in joining my group as a PhD student to work on topics at the intersection of optimization, learning, and statistics.
{#
Example projects include, but are certainly not limited to,

- Science-constrained learning
- Resilience in learning and control
- Ascent-descent dynamics in optimization and sampling
- Rethinking generalization as a learning requirements

Also feel free to [apply](#how-to-apply) if you are interested in any other direction of my research.
#}

Projects in my group are typically at the interface of theory and practice, so there is room for those more mathematically-inclined as well as those more empirically-inclined. While I expect all of my students to know and do a bit of both, there are opportunities for you to position yourself along a wide range of the theory/math&ndash;practice/coding spectrum.

**Deadline**: applications are accepted on a rolling basis (the position will be filled as soon as a suitable candidate is found).  
**Target starting date:** Fall 2025 (flexible)  
{#
**Salary:** 2300&nbsp;€ gross ([How much is that?](#so-how-much-is-my-salary-exactly))  
#}

If you have any questions about the positions and/or life in Paris, do not hesitate to [reach out](mailto&#58;{{SITEEMAIL}}?subject=[App PhD]).

### Additional information

#### Why pursue your PhD here?

At the &Eacute;cole Polytechnique (also known as "X") and the CMAP, you have access to a world-class research infrastructure and support, including high performance computing clusters. You also have the opportunity&nbsp;(and means) to interact with leading scientists from a variety of fields; sit on seminars from noteworthy researchers from around the world; and attend major conferences. X is part of the [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/), among the 50 best universities world-wide and #2 in France ([QS rank](https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/institut-polytechnique-de-paris)). Located on the Plateau de Saclay, it is surrounded by world-class institutions (such as INRIA, Telecom Paris, CentraleSup&eacute;lec, ENSAE, HEC), industrial research centers (such as Danone, Thales), and a vibrant start-up community.

{#
On the&nbsp;(not-less-important) logistic side, while France is known for its bureaucracy,
the requirements for PhD positions here are actually quite straightforward. In particular,

- you are *not* required to take German language exams, TOEFL, GRE, or pay application fees;
- there are *no starting date* restrictions: you can begin your PhD year-round;
- you have the opportunity to take courses, but are *not* required to do so;
- there are *no teaching* requirements;
- PhD programs tend to be shorter (3-4 years), though this is not a rule.

Additionally, you enjoy several benefits, such as

- competitive [compensation](#so-how-much-is-e13-exactly);
- full-time employment by the university that entitles you to social benefits,
  including healthcare, family assistance, and 30 days of paid time-off (holidays);
- fully-funded opportunities to attend conferences.
#}

You can find more information about the French doctorate system at [Campus France](https://www.campusfrance.org/en/what-involved-Doctorate-France). If you have any questions about the positions, the PhD in general, and/or life in France, do not hesitate to [reach out](mailto&#58;{{SITEEMAIL}}?subject=[App PhD]).


{#
#### So how much is my salary exactly?

PhD student minimal salaries are defined nationally by the government. You can easily find *gross* values in the
[law](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jorf/article_jo/JORFARTI000046820748). *Net* salaries are harder to determine
as they depend on your tax situation. In an informal poll of *net* salaries among PhD students, I got to something
in the range of **1700&ndash;1800&nbsp;€** (which is consistent with what you get on [this](https://www.salaire-brut-en-net.fr/) website). These are unofficial estimates and therefore come with the typical caveat on internet sources. It is worth noting that PhD students in France are contracted, full-time employees entitled to the all social benefits of traditional public sector employment, including sick days and paid time-off&nbsp;(holidays).

Again, if you have any questions about the positions, the PhD in general, and/or life in Paris, do not hesitate to
[reach out](mailto&#58;{{SITEEMAIL}}?subject=[App PhD]).
#}


#### Do I need to speak French?

The answer is **NO**. The official and working language of the group is English.
I take this point seriously: having been a foreigner for half of my life, I appreciate the difficulties involved in navigating a new country, culture, and language.
Additionally, many courses are offered in English and the majority of university business can be conducted in English.

Now, *should* you speak French? Probably eventually. Even if Paris is a very international city, speaking French will definitely make your life easier and more fun outside of the university. And if you are going to spend multiple years in a country, you might as well learn the local language. If you do decide to give French a try, there are plenty of French language courses and resources at and around the university, many of them free of charge.

Visitors/Exchanges

I am honored to host self-funded visitors in my lab and will support their effort to secure required funding. In my experience, both the host and visitor are most productive if the terms and the program of the research visit are discussed ahead of time. Please email me at dvorkin@nyu.edu so we can discuss the matter.
