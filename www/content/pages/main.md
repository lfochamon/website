# Hello there!

<p style="font-size: 20px;">I am an assistant professor (tenure-track) and
<a href="https://www.hi-paris.fr">Hi! Paris</a> chair holder
in the center for applied math (<a href="https://cmap.ip-paris.fr">CMAP</a>) of
<a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu">&Eacute;cole polytechnique</a>.
My group develops tools that enable intelligent systems
to <b>extract</b>, <b>process</b>, and <b>act</b> on information.
<!-- I study the theoretical underpinnings of <b>constrained learning</b> and its applications in
<b>signal processing</b>, <b>control</b>, and <b>machine learning</b>. -->
</p>

**I am currently looking for a PhD student interested in working at the intersection of optimization, machine learning, and statistics (applications reviews are scheduled for February/March 2025).<br class="responsive">
Read more on how to join my group [here]({filename}/pages/prospective.md).**

**I have open master research topics on generative models, sampling, and reinforcement learning.<br class="responsive">
[Reach out]({filename}/pages/contact.md) if you are interested in any of these fields or my research more broadly!**
