independent research group leader of the <a href="https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/">University of Stuttgart</a>, Germany.
I head the <b>Information Systems Group</b> associated to the <a href="https://www.ki.uni-stuttgart.de/">AI institute</a>.
We develop tools to enable intelligent systems to <b>extract</b>, <b>process</b>, and <b>act</b> on information.
<!-- I study the theoretical underpinnings of <b>constrained learning</b> and its applications in
<b>signal processing</b>, <b>control</b>, and <b>machine learning</b>. -->
</p>

&nbsp;


**I am joining the center for applied math ([CMAP](https://cmap.ip-paris.fr/)) of the [&Eacute;cole Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.polytechnique.edu/) next January.**<br><br>
**If you are looking to work with me, I will soon be filling a PhD student position.**<br>
**Read more on how to join my group [here]({filename}/pages/prospective.md).**
