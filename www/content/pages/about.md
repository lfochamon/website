# About ([formal bio]({filename}/pages/bio.md))

I am an assistant professor (tenure-track) and [Hi! Paris](https://www.hi-paris.fr) chair holder
in the center for applied math ([CMAP](https://cmap.ip-paris.fr)) of
[&Eacute;cole polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu), France,
broadly interested in optimization, machine learning, signal processing, and control,
and in particular, in the intersections of these fields. In my research, I develop and analyze tools
that enable intelligent systems to **extract**, **process**, and **act** on information. That is,

  - **gather data**,
  <span style="color:#999;font-size:90%;">e.g.,
    using sampling {{- cite('Chamon18g', 'Chamon21a') }} and active learning {{- cite('Chamon17a') }} techniques,
  </span>
  - **turn this data into insights**,
  <span style="color:#999;font-size:90%;">e.g.,
    using ML {{- cite('Chamon20p', 'Robey21a', 'Robey22p', 'Chamon23c')}},
    geometric ML {{- cite('Ruiz20g', 'Ruiz21g', 'Ruiz23t')}},
    and statistical methods {{- cite('Chamon20f', 'Peifer20s', 'Kalogerias20b', 'Arzani180')}},
  </span>
  - and **turn these insights into actions**
  <span style="color:#999;font-size:90%;">e.g.,
    using
    resource allocation {{- cite('Eisen19l')}},
    optimal control {{- cite('Chamon20r', 'Chamon20c', 'Chamon22a')}},
    and reinforcement learning {{- cite('Paternain19c', 'Paternain23s', 'Calvo-Fullana24s')}}
    algorithms.
  </span>

My goal is to design AI systems that can learn and adapt with minimal human intervention while ensuring that they comply with rigorous operational requirements,
such as robustness {{- cite('Chamon20p', 'Robey21a','Robey22p', 'Chamon23c') }},
fairness {{- cite('Chamon20p', 'Chamon23c') }},
safety {{- cite('Paternain19c', 'Paternain23s', 'Calvo-Fullana24s') }},
smoothness {{- cite('Cervino23l') }},
and invariance {{- cite('Hounie23a') }}.

### My background

I did my Ph.D. at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/) immediately followed by a postdoc at the
[Simons Institute](https://simons.berkeley.edu/) of the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/). During this time, I developed

- [**near-optimal selection methods**]({filename}/pages/research.md#combinatorial-optimization-and-approximate-submodularity)
  for experimental design {{- cite('Chamon17a') }}, actuator scheduling {{- cite('Chamon22a') }}, and sampling {{- cite('Chamon18g', 'Chamon21a') }};
- the theoretical and algorithmic foundations of
  [**sparse functional programs**]({filename}/pages/research.md#non-convex-functional-optimization), showing that sparsity
  is tractable on the continuum {{- cite('Chamon20f') }} and can be used for
  nonlinear line spectral estimation {{- cite('Chamon20f') }},
  fitting multi-resolution kernel models {{- cite('Peifer20s') }},
  and learn Gaussian Processes from data {{- cite('Chamon19l') }};
- a [**graphon signal processing**]({filename}/pages/research.md#non-convex-functional-optimization)
  framework&nbsp;(in collaboration with [Luana&nbsp;Ruiz](https://sites.google.com/seas.upenn.edu/luanaruiz)) {{- cite('Ruiz21g') }}
  that we used to demonstrate the transferability of **graph neural networks** {{- cite('Ruiz20g', 'Ruiz21t') }};
- a new [**risk-aware estimator**]({filename}/pages/publications.md#Kalogerias20b)&nbsp;(together with
  [Dionysios&nbsp;Kalogerias](https://www.dkalogerias.org/)) that received the
  [*best paper award*](https://2020.ieeeicassp.org/general/icassp-best-paper-awards/) at ICASSP 2020;
- **constrained [learning](({filename}/pages/research.md#)) and [reinforcement learning]((({filename}/pages/research.md#)))** theory and algorithms to enable the design of intelligent systems that satisfy requirements
such as robustness {{- cite('Chamon20p', 'Robey21a','Robey22p', 'Chamon23c') }},
fairness {{- cite('Chamon20p', 'Chamon23c') }},
safety {{- cite('Paternain19c', 'Paternain23s', 'Calvo-Fullana24s') }},
smoothness {{- cite('Cervino23l') }},
and invariance {{- cite('Hounie23a') }}.

After that, I spent two years as the [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/)&ndash;[SimTech](https://simtech.uni-stuttgart.de/) independent research group leader of the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/), Germany.

Prior to moving to the US, I received my bachelor and master degrees in electrical
engineering from the [University of São Paulo](https://www.poli.usp.br), Brazil,
where I am originally from. My masters thesis was on
[**combinations of adaptive filters**]({filename}/pages/research.md#combinations-of-adaptive-filters),
but I also worked on innovative digital design projects&nbsp;(with [David&nbsp;Lamb](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidlamb99/)),
one of which was [**patented**]({filename}/pages/publications.md#patent) by Analog Devices. As an undergraduate, I studied acoustics
during an exchange at the [École Centrale de Lyon](https://www.ec-lyon.fr) and [INSA-Lyon](https://www.insa-lyon.fr), France.

Before starting my graduate studies, I spent a semester teaching certifying courses
and consulting on nondestructive testing at INSACAST Formation Continue in Lyon, France,
and worked as a signal processing researcher and statistics consultant on a
[project with EMBRAER]({filename}/pages/research.md#aircraft-cabin-simulator).



### Personal interests

In my spare time, I like to write and play music. Mostly the acoustic guitar and the piano, but I sometimes pretend
to play the violin, the flute, and typical Brazilian percussion instruments, such as the zabumba and the triangle.
I used to play the accordion in a *forró* band named [Quaraçá](https://soundcloud.com/luiz-chamon/sets/quaraca), meaning
sun ray or sun light in a Brazilian indigenous language. *Forró* is a folk music genre from the Northeast of Brazil that is
surprisingly widespread worldwide: I've managed to find some underground Forró dance party in almost every city I've lived in.

Back in Brazil, I worked in many recording studios&nbsp;(most small, some even smaller) and was involved in the production of
international theater and art exhibitions, notably Bob Wilson's "Quartett"&nbsp;(with Théâtre de l’Odéon, France) and
Wajdi Mouawad's "The three sisters"&nbsp;(with Théâtre du Trident, Canada). This is actually how I got interested in electrical engineering and
later, signal processing. Amidst the 2020 pandemic, I went back to recording in what served as my bedroom/office/gym/homestudio
and released my first solo EP, *Philathina*, in July&nbsp;2022. You can check it out on my [music&nbsp;website](https://www.lfochamon.com) or
any major music streaming service&nbsp;([Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/4dLuLYglloY8fPcuK9uNrU),
[Apple music](https://music.apple.com/gr/album/philatinha-ep/1637179028?uo=4), [Amazon music](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B0B82T289X),
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr22lwhElvc&list=OLAK5uy_m2dR9NIMG6BTEK_zE9UG3NSIcsLIYOPoc&index=1), [Tidal](http://www.tidal.com/album/240501656)...).

While I don't play live anymore, I've made a few guest appearances on [Tau-zeta's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@tau-zeta3461),
the first of which singing&nbsp;(if you can call that "singing") one of my favorite Greek songs.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Besides music, I like learning languages and discovering cultures. I speak a few languages to varying degrees of success,
the latest addition being German with degree unsuccessful. I've also been pretending to speak Greek for a couple of years now.
I don't always pretend very well.

During my Ph.D., I was part of a group of soccer lovers that founded the
[Philadelphia Open Soccer](https://www.philadelphiaopensoccer.org/)&nbsp;(or on
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/phillyopensoccer/)), a program that taught soccer to kids in underprivileged
public schools of West Philadelphia and in a
[Northeast Philadelphia](https://www.facebook.com/pg/phillyopensoccer/photos/?tab=album&album_id=1299783973460905) community
composed largely of immigrants and refugees.

Although I don't take soccer as seriously as you'd expect from a Brazilian, I do like watching the *Seleção*&nbsp;(Brazilian national team).
And I understand if right now the thought of mentioning the&nbsp;2014 "7-1" fiasco against Germany crossed your mind.
I'll get back to you on that as soon as your national team also manages to win five World Cups...
